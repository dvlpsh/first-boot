Guide for Stepping into Free Software
======================================

Here is a ToDo List which you could follow to make your first step to Free Software.

How to use this list? You could just fork the whole project as you own or copy and paste the whole content to other place. 

You can finish all these tasks just **in A MONTH**!

## Pre-Start

All listed below are must-have and all important!

- [ ]  English Skill. English is must-have capability to join in a FOSS community. If you cannot read this page without any assistance, please improve your English first.
- [ ]  For Internet searching, using Google or [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), don't use Baidu. Google is not a perfect search engine for respecting your freedom, however it is better than Baidu. For runner-up option, [Searx](https://asciimoo.github.io/searx/) is okay for respecting your freedom.
- [ ]  Learn how to jump outside GFW (you can using ANY method to do it), because most international FOSS projects are outside GFW, and GFW may interrupt connection to their websites, service, and so many things… Remember that if you use someone else's server to jump outside GFW, you have to concern about your privacy, so *ONLY encrypted connection (HTTPS) and encrypted content are allowed ALL THE TIME, especially when you login or submit any privacy information*.

Personal

[1 ~ 2 days]

This section introduces some personal preparation.

 - [ ]  A blog, which can be read and shared out of China (DreamWidth.org, Medium.com, Noblogs.org, Blogger and WordPress are recommended for newcomer)
 - [ ]  Update your profile and resume with skills and FOSS contributions (English and Chinese)
 - [ ]  Generate an OpenPGP (GnuPG) key, upload it to keyserver, and ask friends to sign your public key, Ref: https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org and https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GnuPG . Note that some projects require signing a contributor agreement or other file using your OpenPGP key.

 - [ ]   Translation (Localization, L10n) is a good and easy way to start, even you did not learn computer science.
 - [ ]   Bug report and testing (Quality Assurance) are also easy for newcomer. It will help you familiar with FOSS community's working progress and collaboration tools.
 - [ ]   Writing Documents requires more English writing skills, but it is a good point to join in too.
 - [ ]  Coding, let's divide it into several parts:
       
     > Solve a bug. It is recommended from bite-sized bug, which means you can solve it by only few lines code even only one line.
 
     > Add a new feature to an exist project.
 
     > Refactoring an exist part of an exist project.
 
     > Developing new model for a project.
 
     > Start a new project at a community
 
 - [ ]   Artworks. Every community and project needs artworks, UI/UX design, Website and front-end, LOGO trademark and other VI design.
 - [ ]   Marketing. Most FOSS are free (as in free beer), but still someone to do “marketing”. That's mean publicizing the project, proclaiming releases, call out contributors, event hosting, speech at conferences, social networking…etc.
